title: "Challenges"
description: One of our [core pillars](/home) of work focuses on working with our [challenge partners](/partner) to identify real and important problems they're facing related to genomic equity and to come up with mechanisms for our community (you) to help solve them! These pages list challenges that are coming up, live, and closed. These challenges might be competitive (hackathons), collaborative (workshops), and they might be long-term (internship programmes) or quick to solve, some will be paid or offer rewards and some will be for people who are happy to volunteer their time. Find what interests you and apply today!
