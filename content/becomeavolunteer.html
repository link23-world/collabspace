<p>
link23 volunteers help to source events from the  community (hackathons, data dives, curation sessions), help onboard new contributors to the community, find partners, disseminate new tools, support in structuring/curating/versioning tools in the theme.
<br><br>
We have weekly and fortnightly meetings that you can take part depending what pillar of work most interests you.
We do not ask you to guarantee anytime to link23 but appreciate if you could let us know your minimum expected commitment (e.g., a couple hours per week, fortnight, month, etc.).
We would also appreciate if you could attend as many of our events as possible, it will help us create engaged and exciting events and it will also be fun for you!
<br><br>
