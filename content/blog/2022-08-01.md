This webinar (14th July 2022) features [Dr. Anna Lewis](https://acflewis.com/), where she presents her work on the challenges and pitfalls in how we conceptualise, describe and use ancestry in genomics, as outlined in her paper published in Science earlier this year, [Getting genetic ancestry right for science and society](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm7530), where she advocates for a "multidimensional, continuous view of ancestry and a move away from continental ancestry categories".
