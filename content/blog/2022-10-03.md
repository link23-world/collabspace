{{< quote "Itâ€™s incredibly important that we build up reference data sets in other worldwide populations so that we can learn more about the ancestry of people.">}}

We join James Cook, one of our Bioinformaticians in Research Services at Genomics England and Dr Garrett Hellenthal, a Sir Henry Dale Fellow working on constructing and applying statistical methods to infer human history using genetic data at UCL Genetics Institute (UGI).

They talk about population genetics and diverse data.
