For the second session of our Genomic Equity Series, we are delighted to host our colleagues from [Genome Canada](https://genomecanada.ca/). The fields of genetics and genomics have made previously unthinkable progress over the last two decades. We have shifted from mapping the human genome to sequencing individual genomes for a mere fraction of the cost, and at record speed. During this time of rapid discovery, the Canadian Genomics Enterprise—a unique investment model comprising Genome Canada and six independent regional Genome Centres—has been a driver of impact-focused investments in health, agriculture, natural resources and environmental sustainability. In this talk, Genome Canada will share their on ongoing efforts to cultivate a research ecosystem and organization that embraces inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA), as well as collaborative initiatives to elevate Indigenous genomics leadership in Canada. Recognising that not enough has been done, and that there is momentum to do more, the talk will spotlight challenges and opportunities in the journey to build a Canadian genomics future that is by design inclusive and anti-racist.
