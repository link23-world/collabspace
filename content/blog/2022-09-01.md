This conversation features [Dame Sally Davies](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/sally-davies) with Vivienne Parry, where they discuss the importance of diversity within the contexts of sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis, how diversity in the genome can impact how we respond to our environments, and how to build trustworthy and long-lasting relationships in communities that are underrepresented in genomic research. Lastly, Sally reflects on how diversity would be incorporated if the seminal report, [Generation Genome](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/631043/CMO_annual_report_generation_genome.pdf), was published today.
