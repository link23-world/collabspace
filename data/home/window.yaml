  text: "**link23** is an Open initiative on a mission to improve equity and diversity in the providers, users and beneficiaries of genomic tools and data worldwide. We work across four overlapping pillars focused on: 1) curating existing tools, developing new ones, launching collaborative and competitive challenges, and building an exciting and engaged community all around tools for genomic equity."

We have setup a [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/link23-world) that can be used by anyone as a sandbox, which means we are very open to prototypes and blue skies thinking to allow us to play with new ideas in a sage environment."
